# Overview

This is a To-Do List written in JavaScript. The program will let you create a list on a web browser, add to it, check things off, and remove items. As a software engineer I am trying to learn new skills, languages, and expand my knowledge. My purpose for writing this was to learn the syntax of JavaScript and write some simple beginner code. This program implements using HTML and CSS to disply the program to a web browser.
